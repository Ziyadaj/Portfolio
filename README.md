## Distinctiveness and Complexity
## Compared to the previous CS50W projects, this project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements by implementing several core principles of front-end web development, such as responsiveness and the use of JavaScript for dynamic viewing.

## The website is designed to be responsive, meaning that it adapts its layout and design to fit different screen sizes and device types. This is achieved through the use of CSS media queries, which allow different CSS styles to be applied based on the screen size of the device.

## Furthermore, the website applies back-end functionality through the project uploading model, the model is simple but it satifies the role needed for this webpage.

## The previous projects have their own area of application, compared to this project they dont fall under the same category. It carries over the knowledge gained, but does not use the same functionalities.

## Overall, the combination of front-end principles such as responsiveness and dynamic functionality with a backend system for content management adds a high degree of distinctiveness and complexity to the project, making it stand out from previous CS50W projects.
